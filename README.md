# CCD Spectrograph Analysis

This repo contains a list of scripts and documentation for semestral project for Space Engineering subject over at CTU concerning calculating parameters of a 700 mm Coude Spectograph connected to Perek 2 m optical telescope at Ondřej Observatory under Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

Analysis of data was done using Matlab, zeros, darks and flatfields were analyzed in order to get information about read noise, dark noise and gain of the whole spectrograph.
